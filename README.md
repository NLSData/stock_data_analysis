Stock Data Analysis 

*This respository contains a VBA script that loops through a dataset and records the opening and closing prices for each ticker in the stock data set. The script iterates through all the stock volume, and records the total stock volume for each ticker. The script also calculates the yearly change in the stock prices as well as the % change for each ticker. It will repeat (loop) for every worksheet of the data set, from years 2018-2020.

*From the calculated % change, it will also find the ticker with the biggest % increase as well as the biggest % decrease, and finally find the ticker with the biggest stock volume.

*This repository also contains three screenshots of the dataset from years 2018-2020.


The code I used for conditional formatting was found on Xpert Learning Assistant on the BCS platform. I also got some help for calculating the ticker and stock volume from the in class activities from Week 2, day 3 activity file 6 (credit card activity) and the looping across all worksheets formula from Week 2, day 3 activity file 7 (student census pt.1). I used the format found on stackoverflow to calculate the yearly stock price difference  to round to two decimal places. I got the format to calculate percentage for the percentage change  on excelvbatutor.com/vba_lesson9.htm
