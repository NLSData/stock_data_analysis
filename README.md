Stock Data Analysis

I analyzed the stock data from years 2018-2020. For each year, I calculated the total stock volume, yearly change in the stock prices and then calculated the % change for each ticker.

After calculating all that, we looked for the ticker with the greatest % increase and greatest % decrease, as well as the greatest total stock volume.

The code I used for conditional formatting was found on Xpert Learning Assistant on the BCS platform. I also got some help for calculating the ticker and stock volume from the in class activities from Week 2, day 3 activity file 6 (credit card activity) and the looping across all worksheets formula from Week 2, day 3 activity file 7 (student census pt.1). I used the format found on stackoverflow to calculate the yearly stock price difference and round to two decimal places. I got the format to calculate percentage for the percentage change  on excelvbatutor.com/vba_lesson9.htm
